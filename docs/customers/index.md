<a href="https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/training/assets/detail/navigating-admin-consent-on-a-saas-offer-landing-page-mp4" target="_blank">Video</a>

When customers purchase a SaaS product, they're required to visit the publisher's landing page.

Because the landing page uses Azure Entra ID single sign-on, the customer must sign in to the page. In some cases, customer accounts might not have the right to do this without the consent of their Azure admin.
